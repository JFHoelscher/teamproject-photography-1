## About the project 

This is the repository for the teamproject course, summer term 2021, working on automating photography manipulation.
The plugin is part of the teamproject of the University of T√ºbingen.


### Who are we?

We are 4 students at the University of T√ºbingen and we are all studying computer science. 

Add:

* is used to edit image data sets
* language: Lua
* works with Adobe Lightroom Classic 10.3

## Features

(Of our plug-in)

* The special thing about our plugin is that you can select several images at once and import, export and edit them.
* includes export of your selected images in a matrix-modification format
* processes the images using all possible combinations e.g. Contrast = [10,20], Saturation = [30,40] <br>
the following combinations will be applied on your selected photos: <br>
{[Contrast = 10, Saturation = 30],[Contrast = 10 , Saturation = 40], [Contrast = 20, Saturation = 30], [Contrast = 20 , Saturation = 40]}
* available settings: Exposure, Contrast, Highlights, Shadows, Whites, Blacks, Clarity, Vibrance, Saturation


## Getting Started

### üõ† Set up
+ Create a new directory called "TheImageIterator" under the standard home directory.

  Home directory..

     + for Windows: `C/Users/username/`
  
     + for Mac OS: `/Users/username/`
  
+ Make sure to save the configuration file [`imageIteratorSettings.json`](lightroom_plugin.lrdevplugin/imageIteratorSettings.json) under this folder. 
+ Add the Plug-in in Lightroom Classic: File -> Plug-in Manager... -> Add -> Select the folder of the plugin `lightroom_plugin.lrdevplugin` -> Done
+ Execute the Plug-in: Library -> Plug-in Extras -> The Image Iterator


1. Open the Plug-in Manager after starting Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Desktop: File > Plug-in Manager
2. Add the plug-in: Add-Button
![addplugin](README-files/addingplugin.gif)

4. Choose the pictures you want to edit.
5. Start the plug-in: Library > Plug-in Extras > The Image Iterator
![openplugin](README-files/openplugin.gif)

Add:

* Gifs 
* Starting from Downloading the Folder for the plugin

### Config file
Example for Config file 
```json
{"Highlights":[0,20,50],"Saturation":[10,0,30],"Contrast":[30,40,60]}
```
## Contributing

### How to start programming my own plug-in?
* Read the Lightroom Classic SDK guide. (You don't have to read each chapter). We would recommend reading the first two chapters of the SDK.
* Try to program your own small "Hello World" plug-in using the SDK.

### Which files do I need?
* <b> Info.lua:</b> This file describes your plug-in e.g. the Lightroom Version, the title of your plug-in and more
* Main file or as we call it "the UI file": in our case this file is called <b>"LibraryMenuItemPluginUI.lua"</b>
It is called by the <b>Info.lua</b> file as the main script.
This is where the magic happens. This file implements the whole User Interface of our plug-in as well as a few functions.
(Those are interacting with UI-objects, for example the text-fields.)

### Which files do I need for contributing to TheImageIterator?
* In our case, the most important file is the configuration file called <b>"imageIteratorSettings.json"</b>. 
You can save the settings in the configuration file or use our UI for modifying the configuration file.
The configuration file contains the settings for editing and other infomation. You can store everything about the settings, the export and more in this file. 
We implemented <code> export_format </code> and our Settings for editing. If you want to save for example the metadata, you have to implement functions in the plugin. 
In short, the configuration file contains information for the processing.

* Because it's a JSON-file, it isn't possible to use JSON-code in a Lua script. The solution is called <b>"json.lua"</b>. It's an external file from [this source](https://github.com/rxi/json.lua/blob/master/json.lua). This file makes decoding and encoding easier. 
We changed the lines 85 and 96 for a better look of our configuration file. 
Here is the License for the <b>"json.lua"</b> file: (You can find it in the json.lua as well.)

All the external sources used in our plug-in are listed at the end of this README.

* The file called <b>"AdjustConfigurationFile.lua"</b> is the interface between the <b>"LibraryMenuItemPluginUI.lua"</b> and the configuration file. 
  It checks whether the configuration file exists, reads the configuration file, writes into the configuration file and more.
  For the last two tasks, the <b>"json.lua"</b> is absolutely necessary. 
  
* Another file is the <b>"arrayCombine.lua"</b>. It's an external file as well. [Click here for getting to the source.]("BITTE NOCH EINF√úGEN"). 
Because it's code from Stack Overflow, it is licensed under (https://stackoverflow.com/legal/terms-of-service/public) -- NOCHMAL NACHLESEN! WICHTIG
  We modified the code for our usage. This file gets the settings from the configuration file and creates a new table with all the possible combinations from the settings of our configuration file. The code is well commented, so you should read the comments for understanding each function. 
  
* The last file is the <b>"ExportPhotos.lua"</b>. A very short file with the duty to export our images.

So for summary: 
  * LibraryMenuItemPluginUI.lua
  * json.lua
  * info.lua
  * imageIteratorSettings.json
  * AdjustConfigurationFile.lua
  * arrayCombine.lua
  * ExportPhotos.lua

### Import of the images
The easiest way for importing images into our plug-in is to import them into the Lightroom Classic Catalog and select them.

 <pre><code>local catalog = LrApplication.activeCatalog()
local targetPhotos = catalog.targetPhotos</code></pre>
In this code, the <code>targetPhotos</code> are the selected photos in the catalog. Now you can work with them. It's that simple. 

### Export images
The <b>"ExportPhotos.lua"</b> file is responsible for the export of our images. You don't have to implement a ExportServiceProvider.
<pre><code> function ExportPhotos.processRenderedPhotos(photos, folderName)</code></pre> gets the images and the foldername for the export. 
This function creates an exportsession where you can change the settings for the export e.g. the format. 
We used <pre><code> LR_export_destinationPathSuffix = folderName </code></pre> for exporting in different folders. Each time the function <code> function ExportPhotos.processRenderedPhotos(photos, folderName)</code> is called, the photos will be exported in the associated folders. If you want to export all of the images into one folder then you have to change the variable <code> folderName </code> into a string.

### Editing images
We use the function <code> photo:quickDevelopAdjustImage(settingName, size)</code> from the class called "LrPhoto" for editing our images.
The following settings are available for editing with this function: 
* Exposure
* Contrast
* Highlights
* Shadows
* Whites
* Blacks
* Clarity
* Vibrance
* Saturation

You can find more settings in the Namespace "LrDevelopController". The settings that we have not listed, <b> can not be used </b> within the  <code> photo:quickDevelopAdjustImage(settingName, size)</code>. 
If you want more available settings, you have to implement the whole Develop Controller.

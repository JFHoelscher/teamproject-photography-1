## About the project 

This is the repository for the teamproject course, summer term 2021, working on automating photography manipulation


who are we?

We are 4 students at the University of T√ºbingen and we are all studying computer science (2 computer science, 1 medical informatics, 1 media informatics) and have been working together on this project since the summer semester began.
on 07/27/2021 is our final presentation of this project

Add:

* is used to edit image data sets
* language: Lua
* works with Adobe Lightroom Classic 10.3

## Features

(Of our plug-in)

* The special thing about our plugin is that you can select several images at once and import, export and edit them.

* import and export pictures
* save pictures in folder
* change settings (contrast, saturation, highlights)

## Getting Started

### üõ† Set up
+ Make a new directory under the standard home directory called "TheImageIterator".

  Home directory..

     + for Windows: C/Users/username/
  
     + for Mac OS: /Users/username/
  
+ Make sure to save the configuration file "configurationFile.json" under this folder. 
+ Then execute the plugin.  


* Error messages have 3 parts:

lib/a_name_error.rb:3:in `<main>': undefined local variable or method `hello_world' for main:Object (NameError)


1. The location of the error, the "where".

lib/a_name_error.rb:3:in `<main>:

* lib/a_name_error.rb is the file the error occurred in.
* 3 is the line of code with the error.
* <main> is the scope of the error.
  
  
2. The description, the "why".
  
undefined local variable or method `hello_world' for main:Object
  
The interpreter does the best job it can to tell you what it thinks went wrong.
  
  
3. The type of error, the "who".

## About the project 

This is the repository for the teamproject course, summer term 2021, working on automating photography manipulation


who are we?

We are 4 students at the University of T√ºbingen and we are all studying computer science (2 computer science, 1 medical informatics, 1 media informatics) and have been working together on this project since the summer semester began.
on 07/27/2021 is our final presentation of this project

Add:

* is used to edit image data sets
* language: Lua
* works with Adobe Lightroom Classic 10.3

## Features

(Of our plug-in)

* The special thing about our plugin is that you can select several images at once and import, export and edit them.
* includes export of your selected images in a matrix-modification format
* processes the images using all possible combinations e.g. Contrast = [10,20], Saturation = [30,40] <br>
the following combinations will be applied on your selected photos: <br>
{[Contrast = 10, Saturation = 30],[Contrast = 10 , Saturation = 40], [Contrast = 20, Saturation = 30], [Contrast = 20 , Saturation = 40]}
* available settings: Exposure, Contrast, Highlights, Shadows, Whites, Blacks, Clarity, Vibrance, Saturation


## Getting Started

### üõ† Set up
+ Create a new directory called "TheImageIterator" under the standard home directory.

  Home directory..

     + for Windows: `C/Users/username/`
  
     + for Mac OS: `/Users/username/`
  
+ Make sure to save the configuration file [`imageIteratorSettings.json`](lightroom_plugin.lrdevplugin/imageIteratorSettings.json) under this folder. 
+ Add the Plug-in in Lightroom Classic: File -> Plug-in Manager... -> Add -> Select the folder of the plugin `lightroom_plugin.lrdevplugin` -> Done
+ Execute the Plug-in: Library -> Plug-in Extras -> The Image Iterator


1. Open the Plug-in Manager after starting Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Desktop: File > Plug-in Manager
2. Add the plug-in: Add-Button
![addplugin](README-files/addingplugin.gif)

4. Choose the pictures you want to edit.
5. Start the plug-in: Library > Plug-in Extras > The Image Iterator
![openplugin](README-files/openplugin.gif)

Add:

* Gifs 
* Starting from Downloading the Folder for the plugin

### Config file
Example for Config file 
```json
{"Highlights":[0,20,50],"Saturation":[10,0,30],"Contrast":[30,40,60]}
```
## Contributing

### How to start programming my own plug-in?
* Read the Lightroom Classic SDK guide. (You don't have to read each chapter. We would recommend to read the first two chapters of the SDK.
* Try to programm your own small "Hello World" plug-in using the SDK.

### Which files do I need?
* Info.lua : This file describes your plug-in e.g. the Lightroom Version, the title of your plug-in and more
* Main file or as we call it "the UI file": in our case this file is called "LibraryMenuItemPluginUI.lua"
It is called by the Info.lua file as the main script.
This is where the magic happens. This file implements the whole User Interface of our plug-in as well as a few functions. (Those are interacting with UI-objects for example the text-fields.)
### Which files do I need for contributing to TheImageIterator?
* In our case the most important file is the configuration file called "imageIteratorSettings.json". Because it's a JSON-file, it isn't possible to use JSON-code in a Lua script. The solution is called "json.lua". It's an external file from [this source](https://github.com/rxi/json.lua/blob/master/json.lua). 

If you are not sure, here is the License for the "json.lua" file: (You can find it in the json.lua as well.)

All the external sources used in our plug-in are listed at the end of this README.
We changed the lines 85 and 96 for a better look of our configuration file.

* The file called "AdjustConfigurationFile.lua" is the interface between the "LibraryMenuItemPluginUI.lua" and the configuration file. 
  It checks whether the configuration file exists, reads the configuration file, writes into the configuration file and more. For the last two tasks the "json.lua" is absolutely necessary. 
  
* Another file is the "arrayCombine.lua". It's an external file as well. [Click here for getting to the source.]("BITTE NOCH EINF√úGEN"). 
Because it's code from stackoverflow, it is licensed under (https://stackoverflow.com/legal/terms-of-service/public) -- NOCHMAL NACHLESEN! WICHTIG
  
We modified the code for our usage. This file gets the settings from the configuration file and creates a new table with all the possible combinations from the settings of our configuration file. The code is well commented, so you should read the comments for understanding each function. 
  
* The last file is the "ExportPhotos.lua". A very short file with the duty to export our images.

So for summary: 
  * LibraryMenuItemPluginUI.lua
  * json.lua
  * info.lua
  * imageIteratorSettings.json
  * AdjustConfigurationFile.lua
  * arrayCombine.lua
  * ExportPhotos.lua

### Import of the images
The most easiest way for importing images into our plug-in is to import them into the Lightroom Classic Catalog and select them.

 <pre><code>local catalog = LrApplication.activeCatalog()
local targetPhotos = catalog.targetPhotos</code></pre>
In this code the targetPhotos are the selected photos in the catalog. Now you can work with them. It's that simple. 
### Export images
The "ExportPhotos.lua" file is responsible for the export of our images. You don't have to implement a ExportServiceProvider.
<pre><code> function ExportPhotos.processRenderedPhotos(photos, folderName)</code></pre> gets the images and the foldername for the export. 
This function creates an exportsession where you can change the settings for the export e.g. the format. 
We used <pre><code> LR_export_destinationPathSuffix = folderName </code></pre> for exporting in different folders. Each time the function <code> function ExportPhotos.processRenderedPhotos(photos, folderName)</code> is called, the photos will be exported in the associated folders. If you want to export all of the images into one folder then you have to change the variable <code> folderName </code> into a string.
